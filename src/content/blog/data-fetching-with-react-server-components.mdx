## Reference

To introduce React Server Components, we have prepared a talk and a demo. If you want, you can check them out during the holidays, or later when work picks back up in the new year.

<YouTube id="https://youtu.be/TQQPAU21ZUw" />

**React Server Components are still in research and development.** We are sharing this work in the spirit of transparency and to get initial feedback from the React community. There will be plenty of time for that, so **don't feel like you have to catch up right now!**

If you want to check them out, we recommend going in the following order:

1. **Watch the talk** to learn about React Server Components and see the demo.

2. **[Clone the demo](http://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo)** to play with React Server Components on your computer.

3. **[Read the RFC (with FAQ at the end)](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/188)** for a deeper technical breakdown and to provide feedback.

We are excited to hear from you on the RFC or in replies to the [@reactjs](https://twitter.com/reactjs) Twitter handle. Happy holidays, stay safe, and see you next year!
